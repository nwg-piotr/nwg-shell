# nwg-shell project
<iframe src="https://github.com/sponsors/nwg-piotr/button" title="Sponsor nwg-piotr" height="35" width="116" style="border: 0;"></iframe>

**The nwg-shell project aims to create a consistent, GTK3-based user interface for the [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) Wayland Compositor. In order to give the user the greatest possible choice, some interface elements provide several alternative solutions. Just installed shell contains a bunch of presets, which can then be freely modified.**

**Starting from the 0.5.x version, nwg-shell also offers support for the [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) Wayland compositor. All the component apps are Hyprland-ready, and the shell comes with 4 hyprland-* presets. Hyprland support is an addition to the shell, not a standalone feature.**

The project is intended for users of all skill levels. Beginners will find four ready-made and immediately working desktop styles to choose from. Advanced users will get a set of tools to build their own GTK-based user interface.

> I strongly discourage manual editing of .dotfiles. There's a GUI for that. The configuration files are in json format, which does not forgive mistakes.

The user interface mostly consists of dedicated software, but also uses several great third party products, that perfectly fit. Many thanks to their authors for favorable attitude towards feature requests.

The default (preinstalled) terminal emulator is [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot) by Daniel Eklöf. This does not mean that I consider other terminals worse, but that I had to choose one. The remaining elements of the desktop environment, such as the text editor, file manager, web browser, and so on, are left to the user's choice. The author's subjective recommendation might be mousepad, Thunar, and Chromium / Chrome, but it doesn't really make much difference.

On the backend side there's a lot of third party Free Open Source Software. I'll try to list all the applications and libraries in Credits.
