## Desktop styles

Nwg-shell comes with four predefined desktop styles for both sway and Hyprland. Every preset is bound to its own nwg-panel config file and css style sheet. Along with it come settings for the launcher, dock (if present if the preset), notification center, screen locker and the exit menu.
