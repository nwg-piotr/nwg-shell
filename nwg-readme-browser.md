This program was conceived as [rtfm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM) with a graphical user interface. 
It searches the `/usr/share/doc` path for `README.*` files, and displays them in WebKit2.WebView. It supports 
`.md`, `.rst`, `.html` and plain text. As a part of nwg-shell, it shows the internally defined, shell-related 
package list.
